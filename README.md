# Simulation of the Schr√∂dinger equation and atomic orbitals

The code for this project is based on [this](https://ben.land/post/2022/03/09/quantum-mechanics-simulation/) and [this](https://ben.land/post/2022/03/17/complex-wavefunction-visualization/) tutorial. As the tutorials did not provide all of the code necessary to replicate all the outputs, this repository offers a completed, slightly refined version.
